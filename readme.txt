Put your website to make money for you

== Description ==

Earn unlimited Money while you sleep!!!!!!

As a Website Publisher, you recognize that income from the ads you host is vital to continued growth of your online commerce.

Many have found that managing the site ads can be time-consuming an even a drudgery. In order to increase you income it becomes imperative that you establish and manage when and where your ads should appear. If an advertiser's campaign has very precise requiremts , such as only appearing in certain countries or at a specific time of the day, it can be difficult to carry out these types of instructions.

This is where an ad server like Nuvem ADWorks can make the differnce between success and failure. Nuvem's ad server helps the delivery of ads to your pages, allowing you to control the placement of ads from ADWorks, other ad networks, and in house ads. For example by using ADWorks you can receive ads from the Nuvem network, other networks such as Google or Yahoo, or you can sell your own ad space to specific advertisers.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
